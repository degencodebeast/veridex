"""C-2 (S5) — the time-aligned venue seam: ``TimedVenueQuote`` + the ``VenuePriceSource`` type.

The seam is the ONLY door venue data enters the VvV trust path. A source is keyed by the DECISION
coordinate ``(fixture_id, market_key, side, ts)`` — so a quote is time-aligned to the tick the agent
decides on — and returns a :class:`TimedVenueQuote` (a decimal price + its measured ``staleness_s``)
or ``None`` when no quote is available at/under the caller's freshness bound (CON-006: no
interpolation; missing/too-stale ⇒ ``None``). The numbers a quote carries are venue numbers and
NEVER enter ``AgentAction.params`` / evidence (CON-002) — that boundary is proven in the agent tests.

#
# The source over BACKFILLED frames adds the time-alignment C-2's seam only fixed the SHAPE of:
# on a decision ``(fixture_id, market_key, side, ts)`` it returns the LATEST frame at/before ``ts``
# whose age ≤ ``freshness_s`` (never interpolated, never a look-ahead to a later frame), else
# ``None`` (CON-006). ``venue_source_id`` is a reproducibility hash over the five identity inputs
# (the C-3 Pack ``artifact_content_hash``es + the C-1 coverage hash + freshness + haircut ladder +
# config version); ANY change flips it, so the agent's ``config_hash`` pins exactly what it priced
# against. The haircut ladder is carried for identity/reporting ONLY — it never touches the returned
# RAW ``venue_decimal_price`` (CON-007; REQ-005).
#
# The WC 1X2 ``market_ref`` ("1X2|home|full", per polymarket_resolver) already embeds the side, and
# the VvV agent passes that SAME string as ``market_key`` — so the lookup keys on ``market_key`` and
# the ``side`` arg is a redundant confirmation of what the ref already names.
