"""Studio deploy route — ``POST /agents/deploy`` (REQ-2D-701 / REQ-2D-702 / REQ-2D-703).

The core product loop: configure → preflight → deploy → observe → verify. A submitted
:class:`~veridex.deploy.preflight.DeployConfig` is TYPED at the wire, BOUNDED by the fail-closed
NAMED preflight, and only then pinned as an :class:`AgentInstance` (config_hash + policy_hash +
template + allowlist + modes). The run is launched ASYNCHRONOUSLY through the SINGLE runner seam
(:func:`veridex_agent.run.standalone_run`) — the response returns ``run_id`` WITHOUT awaiting the
window seal; the background task is tracked on ``app.state`` and cancelled on shutdown. The deployed
run's sealed window verifies via the SAME ``/runs/{id}/verify`` path as an arena run (one flow to
proof). There is NO parallel runner and NO pause/resume/kill beyond shutdown-cancel (CON-2D-701).

Dependency injection: :class:`DeployDeps` lets tests supply an offline feed report, a market-resolved
flag, a fake tick stream + close fetch, and ``anchor_fn=None`` so the whole path runs with ZERO
network. The defaults represent the real live path (real stream/fetch, real anchor).
